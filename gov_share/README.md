## Future Enhancements

### OTP-Based Verification
- Add OTP (One-Time Password) verification via email or SMS to enhance registration security.
- Implement OTP for two-factor authentication (2FA) during login for improved account safety.

### Forgot Password with OTP Verification
- Integrate OTP sent to the userâ€™s registered email or phone for secure password reset flow.
- Ensure token expiry and rate limiting for password reset requests.

### Deployment Guide
- Provide detailed instructions on deploying both frontend and backend on popular platforms:
  - Frontend deployment on Vercel, Netlify, or similar
  - Backend deployment on Heroku, AWS EC2/DigitalOcean, or Azure
- Include environment config, SSL setup, domain mapping, and scaling considerations.
